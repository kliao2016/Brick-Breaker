Kevin Liao - CS 2110 Fall 2017
This is an implementation of a classic GBA Brick Breaker game using C. At the start of the game, the player presses ENTER to start the game and is taken to the first level. The right and left arrow keys are used to move the slider side to side to hit the ball. If the ball moves below the slider, the player loses a life and can press Z to replay the level. If the player loses all lives, then the player loses the game. If the player hits all the bricks on the level, he or she will be taken to the next level. There are a total of four levels and if all four levels are beaten, the player wins and can press ENTER to replay the game. At any point, BACKSPACE may be pressed to go back to the start screen.
